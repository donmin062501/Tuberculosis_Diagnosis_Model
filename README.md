# Tuberculosis_Diagnosis_Model

    • Constructed of convoluntional neural networks (for more detailed info, please look at the model.summary() under TB_classification.ipynb file)

    • Binary classification model (either infected tuberculosis or normal)

    • Demonstrated high prediction accuracy of 85%

# About Datasets...
*China Set - The Shenzhen set - Chest X-ray Database*

The standard digital image database for Tuberculosis is created by the National Library of Medicine, Maryland, USA in collaboration with Shenzhen No.3 People’s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China. The Chest X-rays are from out-patient clinics, and were captured as part of the daily routine using Philips DR Digital Diagnose systems. Number of X-rays:

336 cases with manifestation of tuberculosis, and
326 normal cases.
It is requested that publications resulting from the use of this data attribute the source (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA and Shenzhen No.3 People’s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China) and cite the following publications:
